# Student-Management-System
Student Management System (SMS) is a solution tool that is designed to track, maintain and  manage all the data generated by a School, including the grades of a student, their attendance,  grades etc.
I have tried to make a terminal based program facilitating the same.
These are entities used in my Student Management System- Registrar, Student, Professor, Course.
